# What is paycheck-calc

   paycheck-calc was my first time diving into creating something with a gui. It uses
egui as the gui library. 

   I wipped this up in an afternoon, so I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. I 
got to try out the Model-View-Controller design pattern and make something useful!
