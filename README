paycheck-calc is a, well, paycheck calculator. Written in Rust, it uses the 
egui library for it's GUI. This is the first time I've ever made anything with 
a GUI, so I'm very happy about that! In the future, I'd love to add some
things, like the ability to recal the previous paycheck values to help reduce 
inputing redundant info that most likely won't change. But for now, this is
great!
